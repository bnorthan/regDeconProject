# reg_deconProject
A code collection of the registration and deconvolution project corresponding to the paper: Min Guo et al, rapid image deconvolution and multiview fusion for optical microscopy, Nature Biotechnology (2020).

This repository covers most functions and implementations reported in the paper. All codes, except the deep learning program DenseDeconNet, now run in MATLAB. The dependency C++/CUDA library for the codes has been compiled and attached in the release package. User can also find the source code of the C++/CUDA library at: https://github.com/eguomin/microImageLib.

In addition, the diSPIM data processing programs have been split to another repository and will be maintained independently: https://github.com/eguomin/diSPIMFusion
